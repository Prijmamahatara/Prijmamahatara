# Case Studies

Here you’ll find selected projects that highlight my strengths in **workflow documentation**, **ERP/SAP analysis**, and **business analytics**.

## ERP/SAP Documentation
Structured documentation of pack site configurations, key tables, and business rules to support consistent global operations.

##  Workflow Analysis
Mapped end-to-end workflows, clarified system touchpoints, and created specs to support enhancements.
